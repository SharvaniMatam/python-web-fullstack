###  What is React 
  - React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces 

### Why React 
  - React lets you build components in declaretive way and it uses Virtual DOM to keep track UI state updates in memory which is typical Object and equivalent to real DOM.

  - VDOM helps to update real DOM in minimal way by using diffing algorithm which is the main reason for faster UI updates  

### React fundamentals 
  
  **component**
    - Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation

    - Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen

  **JSX**
    - It stands for Javascript XML, the JSX syntax allows us to write HTML in React/JavaScript.

    - We can say its syntax for combining html and JavaScript code 

  **state**

  **props**
